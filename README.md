- OSI model

    It is a framework that describes how computers communicate in a network, divided into seven layers, from physical to application.

- Different types of networking

    LAN, WAN and Internet

- LAN network

    (Local Area Network): A network of computers limited to a small geographical area, such as an office or a building.

- WAN network

    (Wide Area Network): A network that covers a large geographical area, like a network connecting different branches of a company in different cities.

- Internet

    A global network of interconnected computers that use the Internet Protocol to share information and resources.

- MAC address

    It is a unique identifier assigned to each network device. It is a combination of numbers and letters that enables communication at the data link layer.

- What is an IP address

    It is a unique number assigned to each device in a network to identify it. It enables communication at the network layer. There are two main versions:

- Private and public address

    Private addresses are used in local networks and are not accessible from the Internet. Public addresses are assigned by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) and are accessible on the Internet.

- IPv4 and IPv6

    It uses addresses composed of four numbers separated by dots (e.g., 192.168.0.1).

    It uses addresses composed of eight groups of four hexadecimal digits separated by colons (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334).

- Localhost

    It is a special address that refers to the local device itself. It is used to access services hosted on the same device.

- TCP and UDP

    These are communication protocols used on the Internet. TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) provides reliable and ordered communication, while UDP (User Datagram Protocol) offers faster but unreliable communication.

- TCP/UDP ports list

    These are identification numbers used by TCP and UDP protocols to address specific services on a computer. Some common examples are port 80 for HTTP (web browsing) and port 53 for DNS (domain name resolution).

- What is ping/ICMP

    Ping is a network utility that sends an Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) echo request to a device to verify its availability and measure latency. It is useful for diagnosing connectivity issues.

- Positional parameters

    In programming, positional parameters are values passed to a program or function in a specific order, based on their position in the command line or function call.
